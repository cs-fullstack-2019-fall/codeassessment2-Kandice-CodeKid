# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember 
# Each club member has a name and a role  
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```

#Club member class, with name and role
class Clubmember:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
    #loop through the club member list and show name and role
    def __str__(self):
        return f'Club {self.role}: {self. name}'

# show the instances of the club members
mem1 = Clubmember('Alfred', 'President')
mem2 = Clubmember('Troy', 'Vice President')
mem3 = Clubmember('Albert', 'Secretary')
mem4 = Clubmember('Bob', 'Treasurer')
mem5 = Clubmember('Lorenzo', 'Sargent at Arms')

# loop through each instance of club member and print
members = [mem1, mem2, mem3, mem4, mem5]
for eachMember in members:
    print(eachMember)
